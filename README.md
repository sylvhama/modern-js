# Road to Modern JavaScript and React

*"ES6 is JavaScript"* (from [How to learn ES6](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/how-to-learn-es6-47d9a1ac2620))

The purpose of this guide is to provide a list of several free ressources (articles :pencil:, books :book:, videos :clapper:) which will help you to learn ECMAScript 6 (also knows as ES6 or ES2015) and the framework React.

## 0) ES5 foundations
Before digging into ES6, let's make sure that we understand some ES5 common concepts:
- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) :book: is the perfect reminder to review JS and some general programming concepts.
- [Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/) :pencil: From the basics to advanced topics with simple, but detailed explanations.
- [Functionnal Programming in Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84) :clapper:, those videos are made by a former Spotify JS developer. He will teach you essential concepts like Promises, Closures or Higher Order Functions. Those things are essentials in React.

- [Prototypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain) :pencil:, it's nice to understand prototypes in JavaScript since ES6 class is only syntactical sugar, JavaScript remains prototype-based.
